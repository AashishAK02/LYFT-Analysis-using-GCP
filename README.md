# Procedure
- Understand the Entity relationship
- Process the data "check the given file"
- Create an account in Google Cloud Platform
- Create a vm
- Install required things

- Copy your public ip and add the port number(which is generated while you install mage on vm) on browser
- Follow the 3 process(Data Loader, Data Transformer , Data Exporter) and export it to Google Bigquery
- In gcp open Google Query and load the data from mage
- Enter the query which is provided to you 
- now open Google looker and import data from Google Query
- create a dashboard it's upon your creativity
